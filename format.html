<h3>"Poster" Sessions</h3>
<div class="break"></div>
<p>For each paper being presented at the workshop, we will host (1) the pre-recorded presentation from SlidesLive, (2) a RocketChat chatroom for text-based discussion, and (3) a Zoom meeting room. All of these can be found from each paper's landing page (which you can access by visiting the <a href="/papers.html">Papers</a> page and then clicking on the relevant paper).</p>
<p>The Zoom meeting rooms will be open only during the poster session timeslots (see the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a>), during which authors will join the meeting rooms to allow you to ask them questions face-to-face. We encourage you to first watch the presentation associated with the paper, and then join the Zoom meeting room to ask questions and engage in further discussion.</p>
