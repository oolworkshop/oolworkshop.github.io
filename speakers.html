    <td><b><a href="https://fabienbaradel.github.io/">Fabien Baradel</a></b> is a PhD student at INSA-Lyon. His
      research interests include causality, perception, and video understanding. His recent work is on counterfactual
      learning of physical dynamics. </td>

    <td><b><a href="http://www.culhamlab.com/jody-culham">Jody Culham</a></b> is a Professor in the Department of
      Psychology at Western University in London, Ontario. Her research focuses on how vision is used for perception
      and to guide actions in human observers. In order to answer these questions, she makes use of several techniques
      from cognitive neuroscience, including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and behavioral testing. </td>

    <td><b><a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/Moira-Dillon.html">Moira Dillon</a></b> is an Assistant Professor of
      Psychology at New York University (NYU). Her main research question is how the physical world in which we live
      shapes the abstract world in which we think. She addresses this question by exploring the origin and development
      of uniquely human geometric understanding. </td>

    <td><b><a href="https://qwlouse.github.io/">Klaus Greff</a></b> is a PhD student at IDSIA. His research interests
      include perceptual grouping, object-centric representation learning. His recent work is on unsupervised
      object-based perception models. </td>

    <td><b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vzr1RukAAAAJ&hl=en">Igor Mordatch</a></b> is a research
      scientist at Google Brain. His research focuses on model-based RL, multi-agent RL, and object-based concept
      learning using energy-based models. </td>

    <td><img src="images/sitzmann.jpeg" width="150px"/></td>
    <td><b><a href="https://vsitzmann.github.io/">Vincent Sitzmann</a></b> is a PhD student at Stanford University.
      His research interest lies in neural scene representations - the way neural networks learn to represent
      information on our 3D world. He is interested in learning to reason about our world given visual observations,
      such as inferring a complete model of a scene with information on geometry, material, lighting etc. from only a
      few observations. </td>

    <td><b><a href="https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/smith-linda.html">Linda Smith</a></b> is a Distinguished
      Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Indiana University. Her main research interests include the
      interaction of perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic factors in the psychology of objects and dimensions from a
      developmental perspective. </td>

<!--      <td><b><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/">Yejin Choi</a></b> is an Associate Professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and also a senior research manager at AI2 overseeing the project Mosaic. Her recent research focus on commonsense knowledge and reasoning, neural language generation, and language grounding with vision. She was a recepient of Borg Early Career Award (BECA) in 2018, among the IEEE’s AI Top 10 to Watch in 2015, a co-recipient of the Marr Prize at ICCV 2013, and a faculty advisor for the Sounding Board team that won the inaugural Alexa Prize Challenge in 2017.  </td>-->

<!--      <td><b><a href="http://alisongopnik.com/">Alison Gopnik</a></b> is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley.  She is a world leader in cognitive science, particularly the study of children’s learning and development. Alison is especially interested in how children learn about the causal structure of the world—how some things make other things happen. Her lab explores how children learn by observing statistical patterns, doing experiments and watching the experiments of others.</td>-->
