title: "Generating Stochastic Object Dynamics in Scenes"
abstract: "We introduce Generative Structured World Models (G-SWM), a novel object-centric generative model for videos. The G-SWM not only unifies the key properties of previous models in a principled framework but also achieves two crucial new abilities, multimodal uncertainty, and situated behavior. By investigating the generation ability in comparison to the previous models, we demonstrate that G-SWM achieves the best or comparable performance for all experiment settings including a few complex settings that have not been tested before."
