title: "Learning from an infant's point of view"
abstract: "Learning depends on both the learning mechanism and the structure of the training data, yet most research in human learning and efforts in machine learning concentrate on the learning mechanisms.  I will present evidence on the everyday-day ego-centric visual experiences of infants.  The regularities differ fundamentally and in  multiple inter-related from current approaches to training in machine learning and perhaps will offer inspiration to more powerful, more incremental, and more autonomous machine learning."
